<h1>Project Description</h1>

Customer churn is when existing customers stop doing business with a company. Understanding churn is very important for businesses because retaining customers is often cheaper than acquiring new ones. This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data to identify patterns, predict customer behavior, and provide actionable insights. Using Python for data processing and Power BI for visualization, the project combines data science and business intelligence to help businesses reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction.

The project uses a dataset of customer information, including demographics, services subscribed, account details, and whether or not the customer churned. With this data, we apply exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and dashboard reporting to present meaningful insights to decision-makers.

<h1>Objective</h1>

The main objectives of this project are:

  -To explore and understand the factors that influence customer churn.

  -To build predictive models that can identify customers at high risk of leaving.

  -To create interactive visualizations in Power BI for monitoring churn patterns.

  -To provide recommendations for reducing churn and improving customer retention strategies.

<h1>Python Source File</h1>

The Python source file (churn analysis.ipynb) contains the core data analysis and machine learning steps. Key tasks include:

  -Data Preprocessing: Cleaning missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical values.

  -Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing churn distribution, customer tenure, service usage, and billing patterns.

  -Feature Engineering: Creating useful variables that improve model performance.

  -Model Building: Training machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Trees to predict churn.

  -Model Evaluation: Using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure performance.

The Python workflow ensures that raw data is transformed into meaningful insights and predictive capabilities.

<h1>Power BI File</h1>

The Power BI file (churn_analysis.pbix) presents interactive dashboards that make the analysis more business-friendly. The dashboards include:

  -Customer Overview: Distribution by gender, contract type, and payment method.

  -Churn Analysis: Percentage of customers who churned vs. retained.

  -Key Drivers of Churn: Impact of tenure, monthly charges, and services subscribed.

  -Predictive Insights: Highlighting high-risk customers for proactive retention actions.

Power BI helps stakeholders explore churn data visually and make data-driven decisions without needing technical expertise.

<h1>Results</h1>

From the analysis, several key findings emerged:

  -Customers with month-to-month contracts churned at a much higher rate compared to those with yearly contracts.

  -High monthly charges were strongly linked to increased churn probability.

  -Customers using fewer services or lacking tech support were more likely to leave.

  -Predictive models achieved good accuracy, with Random Forest performing the best in identifying potential churners.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

This project successfully combined Python-based analysis with Power BI dashboards to provide a complete churn analysis solution. The insights revealed that contract type, service usage, and billing amounts are strong predictors of churn. Businesses can use these findings to design retention strategies, such as offering discounts, bundling services, or improving customer support for high-risk customers.
Overall, the project demonstrates the value of combining data science and visualization tools to solve real business problems. By predicting and preventing churn, organizations can save costs, improve customer loyalty, and strengthen long-term profitability.
